N.B. this file is subject to (rapid) change:

There are three key collections:

mudfiles: contains the MUD files themselves and most of the parsed
	  fields in the top mud container, and the expiry of those
	  entries.  Also contains the controller mappings.
	  Primary key: URI

policies: contains policies directly tied to MUD URLs.  Primary key
	  is the URI.  This collection also contains the VLAN_ID to
	  be used with a policy.  That's a bug.  It should be
	  normalized to the _id of a document in the vlans collection.

vlans:	  contains available and assigned VLANs.	  
	  The model is implemented is as follows:
	  
	  VLAN_ID: the VLAN #

	  v4addrmask: a permitted ACE match for this VLAN
	  v6addrmask: as above for v6.
	  Owners: an array of either authorities or URLs.
	          If Owners has no elements, it is available
		  for assignment.

Note that vlans can be populated from the config file with new
free entries.
